slowcontrol system for general use, eg. in home automation.
Written in C++, uses a postgres server as database backend.

This is work in progress, so even basic parts may change at any
time. The project servers not only the purpose of creating an 
useful slowcontrol but also as programming exercise and playground
for concepts.

It requires https://github.com/BGO-OD/OptionParser to build.
